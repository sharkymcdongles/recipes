# Mushroom Risotto

## Ingredients:

- 1 bottle of dry white wine (Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc; choose a quality wine you'd enjoy drinking)
- 200g Arborio or Carnaroli rice (Carnaroli has larger grains and is more forgiving)
- 4 shallots, minced
- 100g grated Parmesan cheese (adjust quantity to taste)
- 1 tsp saffron, infused in 1 tbsp boiling water
- Chanterelle mushrooms, cleaned and washed (quantity is flexible)
- Dried porcini mushrooms if making a mushroom stock
- 1 liter chicken, mushroom, or vegetable stock
- 80g butter
- Olive oil
- 3 tbsp fresh parsley, finely chopped

## Instructions:

1. **Prepare Stock**: Create a pot of your chosen stock. For an elevated mushroom stock, follow this [guide](https://youtu.be/mSuNLVZ7MvE). Add kombu for extra umami. Keep the stock unsalted or minimally salted, as it will concentrate later.
    - *Note*: Have a ladle in the pot, ready for use.

2. **Prepare Mushrooms**: Either sauté in oil or try the new popular method found [here](https://youtu.be/OPJmJdStvwI). Do not overly season. Set aside.

3. **Cook Shallots**: Sauté shallots in butter and a small amount of olive oil on medium heat until soft and translucent. 

4. **Prepare Rice**: Add rice to the pan with shallots and stir until well-coated and semi-translucent. Increase heat, add a glass of white wine, and cook until alcohol evaporates. Stir in the saffron.

5. **Cook Risotto**: Add a ladle of stock at a time, stirring and simmering until reduced before adding another ladle. Continue until rice is cooked to your liking. The texture should be slightly goopy due to the starch.

6. **Final Touches**: Stir in Parmesan and parsley. Turn heat to low, add some of the prepared mushrooms, and mix. Serve hot, topped with the remaining mushrooms.
